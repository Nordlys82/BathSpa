                <br>
                    One day whilst out shopping, I saw a giant Panda by the dairy section of the local Asda. I 
                    thought nothing of, as I reached for my usual block of mature cheddar cheese. Upon seeing my hand
                    move towards the blocks of cheddar, the panda got very irate and tipped my shopping trolley over 
                    on it's side, vehmently saying that "you never say no to panda". Standing there, mortified, 
                    I swore that I would carry on saying "no to panda". This enraged the panda further, so I left 
                    hoping that I would never encounter this angry creature again. However, little did I know that 
                    this Panda would start a vendetta against me and has somehow managed to implant himself into my 
                    BathSpa works folder.
