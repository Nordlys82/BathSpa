                    Heilung is an experimental folk music band made up of members from Denmark, Norway, and 
                    Germany. Their music is based on texts and runic inscriptions from Germanic peoples of the Bronze Age[citation needed], 
                    Iron Age, and Viking Age. Heilung describe their music as "amplified history from early medieval 
                    northern Europe". Their music is usually about Germanic deities, The Jǫtnar, and valkyries. 
                    "Heilung" is a German noun meaning "healing" in English.

                    Heilung was founded in 2014 in Copenhagen, Denmark by vocalist Kai Uwe Faust (a German tattoo artist who specializes in 
                    Old Norse tattoos) and Danish producer Christopher Juul. Juul, who had operated his own recording studio, Lava, in Copenhagen 
                    since 2003, admired Faust's visual work as a tattoo artist, so they struck a deal: Faust offered Juul 
                    some free tattoos in exchange for help recording some poems. Thus Heilung was started.

                    Later in 2015 Maria Franz (Juul's longtime girlfriend and a singer in progressive rock/pop-rock band Euzen in which Juul also
                    played piano and electronics) started to work with Heilung – originally as a session vocalist. In 2015, the band self-released 
                    their debut album, Ofnir, and soon after that Maria Franz became the band's third official member.

                According to Faust, the name of the band, "Heilung", which means "healing" in German, says something about the style of the band: "The listener is supposed to be left at ease and in a relaxed state after a magical musical journey that is at times turbulent". The recordings of the band are not limited to music, but also contain poems and the spoken word.

                The references to the early ages of European Civilization are also made by using texts from historical artefacts or historical poems. The languages used are varied, with German, English, Gothic, Old High German, Icelandic, Latin, Old English, Proto-Norse, Proto-Germanic, and Viking age Old Norse being used.
